I am pretty sure Nick identifies as a man, and he has not undergone any hormone treatments in 1922!! However -- I would say there is definite evidence that Nick has homo-erotic tendencies and most likely is in love with Gatsby. <br /><br />I had read the novel twice and I never thought this before. But upon my 3rd read I discovered some passages that indicate Nick\\\\\\'s homosexual tendencies. Namely -- Nick accompanies Mr. McKee home after a night of hard drinking and possibly ends up in his bed (p. 38). There are attractive women at the party, Nick has been paired off with Catherine, yet he leaves her and follows Mr. McKee, a total stranger, all the way home! In another incident, Nick is riding the train and he fantasizes about kissing the male conductor (p. 115). In another passage, Nick laments turning thirty and the fact that his list of \\\\\\'single men\\\\\\' is dwindling (p. 135). These incidents are coupled with the fact that Nick repeatedly turns down offers from women, including Jordan Baker, girls from his home town and office romances. Nothing ever develops between Nick and any women, nor does he express desire for them. In such a beautifully written novel, Nick\\\\\\'s attraction to any female would surely have been emphasized. But it is not. His infatuation for Gatsby is told many times and in great detail! <br /><br />These clues are subtle, the kind of thing a reader might easily pass over. However, upon my 3rd read I must say the implications are definitely THERE. <br /><br />It is a very layered and complicated novel. I believe Fitzgerald was attempting to encompass several sections of society. Why was he so vague? Remember, the novel was published in 1925, a time when people were jailed, beat up and killed for homosexuality. <a class=\"jsHide hideAction\" href=\"#\">(less)</a></span></span>\\\\n</span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'communityAnswerFooter\\\\\\'>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'flagAnswer\\\\\\'>\\\\n<a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link140543\" title=\"Flag this answer as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=140543&amp;resource_type=CommunityAnswer&amp;return_url=%2Fquestions%2F958-is-nick-carraway-transgender-i-couldn-t%2Fanswers%2F140543-i-do-not-think-that\">flag</a>\\\\n</div>\\\\n<ul class=\\\\\\'communityQAFooter answerFooter\\\\\\'>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'communityQuestionAndAnswer\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'communityQuestion\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'questionText\\\\\\'>\\\\n<a href=\"/questions/126528-my-teacher-keeps-on-insisting-that-jay\">My teacher keeps on insisting that Jay Gatsby is black.

(Fun fact: my first read of this took place in the back of the family minivan when I was 13, on a roadtrip to, like, Disney World or something. While thoughts of princesses and mouse-shaped ice cream bars danced in my siblings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 heads, I was reading about moral corruption in the Jazz Age.) (All because I saw online that if a college interviewer asks what your favorite book is, you should say The Great Gatsby. And for some goddamn reason, I was like, <i>Yeah, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s definitely urgent that I, an eighth grade student, be prepared to have a college interview at any moment.</i>) (I only ever had to do one college interview anyway, because only one was required and of COURSE I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t opt into the non-mandatory ones because CANYOUIMAGINE. Guess what? The interviewer did ask me what my favorite book was. Guess what I <i>didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say?</i> The Great f*ckin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gatsby! I panicked and, I think, said <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>, because it was the first non-embarrassing book that came to mind. My life is just one mistake after another.)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1433609312ra/15119965.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Anyway. I loved Daisy then. I loved her two years later, when my English class read it and it was VERY clear that I was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csupposed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to not like her, and, like, fawn over Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s childish ass instead. Which, no. Picture this: fifteen-year-old me, who has Just Decided she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be cool now (a process which involved wearing 15 layers of mascara and <i>no other makeup</i> - neither an exaggeration nor a good look) in a room of twenty fifteen-year-olds, including cool ones, all VEHEMENTLY AGREEING ON SOMETHING.<br><br>But I still stood up for Daisy. Because I have PRIORITIES.<br><br>My senior year of high school, my morals and soul and ability to empathize were challenged by six students and a teacher in AP Lit. But I won the award for being the best English student in my graduating class, so honestly I think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an indication that I also won that argument. <br><br>And now here I am today, prepared to make the same argument to you all.<br><br>And win.<br><br><i>Obviously.</i><br><br>But let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get into this. Here is why Daisy is not only innocent to the VILLAINOUS charges that have been placed upon her, but also the best character in this book and an absolute angel/joy/gift from the heavens. (Does that mean F. Scott Fitzgerald is God?)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1475834753ra/20771360.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Also, this has literally all of the spoilers. And is long. But THOROUGH AND WORTH IT. <s>Maybe.</s><br><br><br><b>One: What was she SUPPOSED to do?</b><br><br>So put yaself in Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes, yeah? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s take it allllll the way back. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a teenage girl who is the hottest sh*t in all of Louisville. (This is a big deal, apparently.) You have SIX DATES A DAY! The phone never stops ringing!!! You have nothing but options!!<br><br>Kidding, kidding. You only have one option, really, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marrying a rich guy. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we <i>love</i> historical gender expectations? I know I do!<br><br>So then one day, this guy who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fiiiiine as hell shows up. And you guys start hanging out all the time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so charming and hot and you guys get along like a house on fire. You have a really great kiss. The guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a captain in the army, and he implies he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supes well off financially. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perfect. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best case scenario for you.<br><br>(This guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jay Gatsby, by the way. In case I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t made that clear.)<br><br>Then the guy has to go off to war. It sucks, sucks, sucks. You two write letters back and forth, but all the while your family is pressuring you. Society is pressuring you. Your friends are making backhanded comments about how you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re still unmarried.<br><br>The war ends. Sweet relief! Jay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming home!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746761ra/23592278.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Except no. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at Oxford, for some reason? And he tells you he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come home? And your letters get sadder and sadder, because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of time. The war ended, and you have nothing to tell your parents.<br><br>So those six dates a day start back up.<br><br>And then this guy pops up in town. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s reallyyyy rich. And buff. And a real society man. And he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not from Louisville - he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a way out. You can see the world with him. Best of all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obsessed with you.<br><br>(This guy is Tom Buchanan.)<br><br>So what do you do? You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. You have to marry him.<br><br>And when you get a letter from Jay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cToo Little Too Late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gatsby, you scream and cry and try to stop the wedding, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing you can do. Ya hafta marry Tom \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems Okay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Buchanan.<br><br><br><b>Two: Now That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s What I Call \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhoops\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</b><br><br>The OTHER fun thing you get to do, in this life as Daisy Buchanan, is have children whether you want them or not.<br><br>For awhile you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind Tom. In fact, you really love him for a bit. He does nice stuff like carry you so your shoes don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch the ground, and the honeymoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great, etc etc. So even though you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have one mother-effin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ounce of an option in whether you want kids or not, when ya get pregnant, you think maybe it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be that bad.<br><br>And then Tom turns out to <i>suuuuuck.</i> You have to leave these places you love, where everyone is full-on obsessed with you, and you have friends and family and as close to a life as you can get, you have to leave because Tom is f*cking everything with girl parts and a ditzy 1920s accent.<br><br>BUT NOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WILL BE FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU. And all you can hope is that she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be a beautiful fool, like Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s girls, so she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be silly enough to be satisfied with life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inability to give her much of anything.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746621ra/23592268.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And Daisy might be beautiful, but she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sure as sh*t no fool.<br><br><br><b>Three: Ho-ly shit wait...does life not suck? Is there such a thing as a second chance?</b><br><br>So you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this new life in New York, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a BFF from Louisville (Jordan Baker), and yes, Tom is cheating on you, but if he maybe just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer the goddamn phone during dinner for once you could just forget about it for literally one freaking second.<br><br>And then GUESS WHAT? Your old pal Nick Carraway is back! A friend, how amazing! HURRAY! And kinda strange, Nick wants you to get a weird one-on-one tea party on with him, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, whatever, Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheating anyway and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not interested in Nick like that but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fun guy and you can just reject him.<br><br>But waitholdupWHOA what a wild coincidence! The guy who was lowkey the love of your life, Jay Gatsby, is also here! How, well, coincidental! You can play catch up and see his bougie-ass house and whatnot. And cry over the fact that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such a horrific asshole that he would leave you totally in the dust without contacting you for years and then all of a sudden appears and is like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very rich as promised I live right across the water from you I can see your house let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get together here are all my fancy shirts I will throw them at you. So glad Nick is here for some reason let\\\\\\'s keep on not letting him leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<br><br>Plus life with Tom, as mentioned, is not extremely great.<br><br>So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, yeah, perfect, okay. Let\\\\\\'s get some Gatsby on.<br><br><br><b>Four: No. No, there is not a chance of life not sucking. Life is terrible and so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into a gUY WHO IS JUST AS BAD.</b><br><br>GUESS WHAT WASN\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T A COINCIDENCE? ANY OF THAT. All along, even the people you trusted most - Nick, Jordan, Gatsby - have been manipulating you. There have been secret plans and lies and tricks and all of these things just to get you to f*ck a guy.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746920ra/23592294.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And if you think about it, Gatsby is not nice or romantic or kind or fair to lil ol Daisy. At all. His expectations are insane. He got to leave her and build a life for himself and live as he wanted and travel and make up this story and be wealthy and throw parties, while she lived with a cheating husband. And after all that, if she wants admission into the life that being with him might give her, she has to say no, she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever happy, there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a moment she loved Tom.<br><br>Ridiculous.<br><br>And when she plaintively says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI love you now. Isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that enough? I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help the past,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just begging Gatsby to accept her. How absolutely tragic. Tom cheats on her, Gatsby expects so much - she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never been fully, truly, without-exception loved.<br><br><br><b>Five: Gatsby literally sucks oh my god</b><br><br>DAISY IS JUST A SYMBOL OF GATSBY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S ABILITY TO CONQUER THE SOCIOECONOMIC CASTE SYSTEM OF THE 1920S. Like, if he can \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Daisy (literally an object), that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not even enough. He has to have HAD DAISY FOREVER. Because then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beaten Tom, the symbol of old money. <br><br>He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so gross, literally. Here are 2 quotes on Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfeelings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for Daisy which illustrate how much he sucks.<br><br><i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy. It increased her value in his eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>Her VALUE. Like she is an OBJECT. Because OTHER MEN were not enough, so he is THE BEST MAN. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747101ra/23592309.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Daisy must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve fallen short of <i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can think up in his ghostly heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>So he made her into this manic-pixie-dream IDEA of a person, and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be mad at <i>her</i> for not living up to it? Nah. Nope. Not going to happen. Gatsby sucks.<br><br><br><b>Six: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the responsible choice, you raging dingbats</b><br><br>So AFTER she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already been pressured by Gatsby to act as though entire swaths of her life didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen, she finds out Gatsby has been lying to her all along - keeping the truth from her in order to protect this psychotic fairytale concoction of a totally goddamn made up story. Like! A! Total! Freak! What the f*ck would you do? If you were going to leave your sh*tty gross husband for what seems like a better life, but really has always been a lie - and a totally full on creepy one at that. And what if you had a daughter, who it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR you love and worry about and she loves you too, so much. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just leave her in the care of that sh*tty creepy cheating disgusting husband, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care less and would not be at all above using her as a chess piece??? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave her when everything you thought you knew was completely made up???? When it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been your dearest loved ones manipulating you all along???<br><br>No, the f*ck you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s choices were protecting her daughter, and sexy times with a con man. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no goddamn choice.<br><br>She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great and smart and responsible. It couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been easy for her to stay with Tom, who SUCKS. She says to his face that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crepulsive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But it was the grown-up option.<br><br>TALK ABOUT A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. She is such a queen.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746621ra/23592271.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br><br><b>Seven: Oh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, I forgot THE LAW THAT MARRIED COUPLES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN LEVELS OF BAD-NESS you fools</b><br><br>Tom sucks. We know this. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a racist cheating bastard, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gross, and he hits Myrtle. He does plenty a\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terrible thing.<br><br>But guess who is not automatically responsible for his actions??? Daisy, b*tch. She totally roasts him up for his <i>Rise of the Colored Empires</i> pseudo-science racism. She simply does not treat people in the same way Tom does. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not him. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the grouping of them both together like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s her fault. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s totally trapped.<br><br><br><b>Eight: Do we know that she knows that Gatsby died? Do we really, really, reallyyyyy know?</b><br><br>When Nick calls her house, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. Like, do we honestlyyyyyy think that the dude who picked up the phone is actually going to tell her he called? Would you be rearing to go if a person you trusted who TOTALLY ACTUALLY MANIPULATED YOU hit you up after ignoring you for weeks like YOU ARE THE VILLAIN?<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747690ra/23592348.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Honestly, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no real sign that Daisy knew he died, but literally what did she owe him anyway. He manipulated her, lied to her, treated her like an object and nearly ruined her life. Totally made a terrible existence into full on garb\\\\xc3\\\\xa0ge. Whatever, man.<br><br><br><b>Nine: The car thing</b><br><br>She was traumatized. Gatsby orchestrated the whole cover-up. <i>He</i> took the wheel, <i>he</i> drove away, <i>he</i> hid the car. She had no clue the whole thing would go horribly wrong. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the one who made all the choices in the aftermath. Duh.<br><br><br><br><br>God this was so long. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m tired. And apologetic. Toward you, for having read a very long thing that I wrote, and toward myself, because I had to write it.<br><br>This should certainly be enough to prove that Daisy Buchanan is a victim to her circumstances and otherwise noble and great and trying her goddamn best in a world in which everyone treats her like the beautiful fool she is totally not.<br><br>Plus her voice is full of money.<br><br>Now go off in your new happy life of being utterly enamored with Daisy Buchanan.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747600ra/23592346.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>--------------------<br>pre-review<br><br><b>Daisy Buchanan Is The Real Hero Of The Great Gatsby</b>: A Thinkpiece<br><br>will be dropping my pi\\\\xc3\\\\xa8ce de r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sistance soon<br><br>(this is my attempt at a fun way of saying, \"review to come and that review will blow your mind and make you realize that daisy is the best part of this book\")</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"15688915356010659465\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review1115578730\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link1115578730\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=1115578730&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_1115578730\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_1115578730\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/1115578730?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">660 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/1115578730?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_1115578730\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/1115578730/comments?reverse=true\">View all 146 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div id=\"comment_224900614\" class=\"brown_comment\">\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\\\\n    \\\\t<a alt=\"Casey Whittaker\" href=\"/user/show/104339093-casey-whittaker\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1612369080p1/104339093.jpg\" alt=\"104339093\" /></a>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\\\\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/104339093-casey-whittaker\">Casey Whittaker</a>\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer10584513752633542650\">No way.

It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn\\\\\\'t for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.<br /><br />But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby\\\\\\'s competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.<br /><br />In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you\\\\\\'ll ever receive.</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"4651556836997374657\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review10973302\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link10973302\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=10973302&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_10973302\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_10973302\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/10973302?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">1210 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/10973302?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_10973302\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/10973302/comments?reverse=true\">View all 66 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_72958473\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/72958473\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Pollopicu\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/2345961-pollopicu\"><img alt=\"Pollopicu\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1361320990p2/2345961.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/72958473?book_show_action=true\">Sep 29, 2009</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Pollopicu\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Pollopicu\" href=\"/user/show/2345961-pollopicu\">Pollopicu</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"did not like it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">did not like it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n                  <em>\\\\n                    This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers.

Fitzgerald certainly kissed the right asses with this one. <br /><br />What garbage. <br /><br />Daisy quote:<br /><blockquote>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re such beautiful shirts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she sobbed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt makes me sad because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen such\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94such beautiful shirts before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</blockquote>...sob..sob.. boo-hoo-hoo. oh Please someone shut her the fuck up. </span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"16224842906841055677\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review72958473\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link72958473\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=72958473&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_72958473\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_72958473\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/72958473?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">975 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/72958473?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_72958473\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/72958473/comments?reverse=true\">View all 156 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div id=\"comment_225324897\" class=\"brown_comment\">\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\\\\n    \\\\t<a alt=\"kristina naydonova \" href=\"/user/show/127548853-kristina-naydonova\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1612533855p1/127548853.jpg\" alt=\"127548853\" /></a>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\\\\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/127548853-kristina-naydonova\">kristina naydonova </a>\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer13213996958340562091\">I think you&apos;re quite mistaken in your notions of utter rudeness towards Daisy; just because your language of the present is tainted with dullness does</span>\\\\n  <span id=\"freeText13213996958340562091\" style=\"display:none\">I think you\\\\\\'re quite mistaken in your notions of utter rudeness towards Daisy; just because your language of the present is tainted with dullness does not mean people of A CENTURY AGO should talk in similar, daftly insipid ways.

You were ahead of your time. If you would have pulled your scam after the invention of reality TV, you would have been a huge star on a show like <i>The Bachelor</i> and a dozen shameless Daisy-types would have thrown themselves at you. <br /><br />Mass media and modern fame would have embraced the way you tried to push your way into a social circle you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t belong to in an effort to fulfill a fool\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dream as your entire existence became a lie and you desperately sought to rewrite history to an ending you wanted. You had a talent for it, Jay, but a modern PR expert would have made you bigger than Kate Gosselin. Your knack for self-promotion and over the top displays of wealth to try and buy respectability would have fit right in these days. I can just about see you on a red carpet with Paris Hilton. <br /><br />And the ending would have been different. No aftermath for rich folks these days. Lawyers and pay-off money would have quietly settled the matter. No harm, no foul. But then you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have realized how worthless Daisy really was at some point. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have dealt with that. So maybe it is better that your story happened in the Jazz Age where you could keep your illusions intact to the bitter end.<br /><br />The greatest American novel? I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know if there is such an animal.

They will be forgotten and their wisdom heard by only a select few who are willing to go looking for it. So it annoys me when books like this are acclaimed by critics and readers alike as the best pieces of fiction in existence (when they are not.) There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so much more out there!<br /><br />Anyway, rant over. The thing I like most about <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is the language, the subtlety\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s and the suggestions, the things that are not directly said but are said nevertheless. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a true feat of writing and at times it reminded me of a stage piece. The dialogue does not give the answers, but it is the character\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s actions and movements (so fantastically narrated) that give the game away: it reveals their internal worlds. <br /><br />As such this is a book that can easily be skimmed over. The plot is basic and relatively unengaging and consequently I think an inattentive reader has a lot to miss here. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all about illusions and false appearances just like real life. The way people perceive us is not how we truly are and sometimes individuals actively work towards creating a desired appearance for the outside world. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easily done with enough time, effort and money. What Gatsby creates for the outside is a dream, an ideal life that looks perfect.<br /><br />However, scratch the surface and it is so very, very, clear that not everything is perfect. His supposed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chappiness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is hollow and dictated by the whims of society. It is fickle, egotistical and driven by status and all the silly little symbols that go with it. His success is what society demands success to be; thus, he positions himself into a place where he can chase his true dream. In doing so Gatsby shows us that not everything is as simple as it appears, and that society driven by such monetary values is a dangerous thing because everybody is so detached from what really matters in life. (The object of his affections, for example.) <br /><br />I enjoyed <i>The Great Gatsby</i> though I certainly did not love it. Its popularity baffles me to a degree, I can think of books from the same era that deserve far more attention. Still, I enjoyed reading it and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad I finally did so.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sean.barrs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a>| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ultra_vegan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a>| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sean.ultra_vegan/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Insta</a>| <a href=\"https://york.academia.edu/SeanBarrs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Academia</a></span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"13431043594463470672\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review2380648078\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link2380648078\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=2380648078&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_2380648078\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_2380648078\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/2380648078?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">414 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/2380648078?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_2380648078\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/2380648078/comments?reverse=true\">View all 30 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_8122372\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/8122372\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Gina\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/384143-gina\"><img alt=\"Gina\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1304700261p2/384143.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/8122372?book_show_action=true\">Oct 23, 2007</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Gina\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Gina\" href=\"/user/show/384143-gina\">Gina</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/384143-gina?shelf=fiction\">fiction</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer8122372\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer14625260205249530036\">Over drinks, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve observed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94like so many smart alecks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that much of <i>The Great Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s</i> popularity relies heavily on its shortness.

At a sparse 180 pages, Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s masterpiece could be argued to be the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat American novella.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d <i>Gatsby</i>, like so many other short classics, is easily readable, re-readable, and assessable to everyone from the attention-deficient young to mothers juggling a kid, a career, and a long-held desire to catch up on all those books \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthey should have read but haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gotten around to yet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d.<br /><br />I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve now read <i>Gatsby</i> three times, and I admit that on my first reading during (like handfuls of others) my senior year English class, I wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t particularly fond of the book; I believe I used the adjective \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9coverrated\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d on numerous occasions. Daisy Buchanan seemed like a twit of a woman, and I found Jay Gatsby to be pathetically clawing in his attempt to attain her. Nick, my guide, only annoyed me further with his apparent hero-worshiping of a man I found one-dimensional and his adoration for the kind of woman I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen other men purport to be goddesses, but in fact, are dim-witted simpletons with nice figures. <br /><br />Over my two subsequent readings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94pushed along by friends whose judgment I trusted and who swore the book was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso funny and ironic\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I discovered within Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fable a sardonic social wit and a heavily layered critique of the American Dream: the poor, working (wo)man rising above his or her social situation to discover money conquers all. <br /><br />Fitzgerald has a discerning ability for sharp critiques of the economically privileged and, like Jane Austin, has an ear for realistic, bantering dialogue. Through Nick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s narration, we see a world that so many Americans dream of (its enviableness only further accentuated by our open disdain for it): a life of endless parties, delicious food, beautiful clothes, and Paris Hilton. Nick who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s paradoxically drawn to his cousin, Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and her husband, Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, lifestyle with gloating contempt echoes the contemporary American idolization of an elite lifestyle that none but a select few attain. <br /><br />We watch Daisy with her voice that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csounds of money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d flit about with uncompromising shallowness and vivacious school-girl frivolity, and through her, see so many of the inconsequential remarks and actions others (as well as ourselves) have made for the sheer sake of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chaving a good time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d. In spite of her frivolity and weak disposition, we become, like Gatsby, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9coverwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<br /><br />Through Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s veneration of Daisy, we not only imagine what so many Americans desire (success), but also we see the goal and glittering fixation of all humanity: beauty. And like many Americans in the throes of Capitalism, Gatsby believes that money can buy beauty as well as love. Fitzgerald articulates this disillusion with haunting force, particularly voiced through Nick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obsessive repulsion with the extravagant society his social status has allowed him and the sadness he finds while watching a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cworking man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d attempt to enter it. <br /><br />One critique of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, which could also be argued as a positive, is the limited scope of action and themes Fitzgerald chooses to encapsulate. We only see the wealthy elite (or people wanting to be the wealthy elite), and only Nick really has any depth of characterization. Unlike a tome, such as <i>War and Peace</i>, <i>Gatsby</i> fails to have numerous interwoven plotlines within a grand historical context. Yes, the Jazz Age is the novel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s backdrop, but Fitzgerald fails to engage in any discussion beyond a summer among the wealthy youth partying into the wee hours of the night in the West Egg. Yet, the control with which Fitzgerald expresses his limited themes makes the novel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lack of scope forgivable.<br /><br /><i>Gatsby</i> is short and easily accessible, and I have no doubt these aspects of the novel do lend to its everlasting popularity. At the same time, it should never diminish its truly admirable ability to tease apart some of the most confounding qualities American culture values: money, beauty, youth, hard work, and the ever effusive, love. </span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"14625260205249530036\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));;

Whatever you call it, this novel is shiny and gorgeous, written with a sort of breezy pretension that seems to mirror the loose morality of the story. Rarely have I come across a book whose style so perfectly enhances its subject matter. <br><br>Set in the eastern United States just after World War I, Fitzgerald shows us an America that has lost its moral compass. This fall from grace is demonstrated through the lives of a handful of cynical \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwell-to-dos\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d living lavish but meaningless lives that focus on nothing but the pursuit of their own pleasures and whims. <br><br>Standing apart from these happenings (while still being part of them) is our narrator, Nick Carraway. As the one honest and decent person in the story, Nick stands in stark contrast to the other characters. <i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i> Nick relays the story of the summer he spent in Long Island\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s West Egg in a small house sandwiched between the much larger mansions of the area. His time in Long Island is spent with a group that includes his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her rich husband Tom who live in Long Island\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s East Egg. At one point in the story, Nick provides the following description of the pair which I do not think can be improved upon: <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.</i>\\\\n</blockquote> In addition, we have Jordan Baker who is a poster child for the pretty, amoral, self-centered rich girl whose view of the world is jaded and unsentimental. Basically, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bitch.<br><br>The most intriguing character by far is Jay Gatsby himself, both for who he is and for how Fitzgerald develops him through the course of the narrative. When we are first introduced to Gatsby, he comes across as a polite, gracious, well-mannered gentleman with a magnetic personality who our narrator takes to immediately. <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself. </i>\\\\n</blockquote> However, from that very first encounter, Fitzgerald slowly chips away at the persona and peels back the layers of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gatsby until we are left with a flawed and deeply tragic figure that in my opinion ranks among the most memorable in all of classic literature. Nick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s journey in his relationship with Gatsby mirrors our own. <i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>Through a series of parties, affairs, beatings, drunken escapades, the lives of the characters intermesh with terrible consequences. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to give away major parts of the story as I think they are best experienced for the first time fresh, but at the heart of Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s morality tale is a tragic love that for me rivaled the emotional devastation I felt at the doomed relationship of Heathcliff and Catherine in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights\" title=\"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\\\\xc3\\\\xab\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Wuthering Heights</a>. In general, Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s world of excessive jubilance and debauchery is a mask that the characters wear to avoid the quiet torments that haunt them whenever they are forced to take stock of their actions. Rather than do this, they simply keep moving. <i>\"I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\" </i><br><br>In the end, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of creating a sad, bleak portrait of America while maintaining a sense of restrained optimism in the future. Both heart-wrenching and strangely comforting at the same time. I guess in the end, this was a book that made me feel a lot and that is all I can ever ask. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to wrap this up with my second favorite quote from the book (my favorite being the one at the very beginning of the review): <blockquote>\\\\n  <i> And as I sat there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby\\\\\\'s wonder when he first picked out Daisy\\\\\\'s light at the end of his dock. He had come such a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it. But what he did not know was that it was already behind him, somewhere in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.</i>\\\\n</blockquote> 5.0 stars.

</i>\\\\n</blockquote>3) <b>\\\\n  <i>Never</i>\\\\n</b> swallow a thesaurus.<blockquote>\\\\n  <i>I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of

/><b>He\\\\\\'s also in love, </b>with one Daisy Buchanan...who\\\\\\'s already married to one, surly, cheating and backstabbing man.<br /><br />Our narrator has front row seats to all<b> the glitz, the glam and the gore</b> that circles around Jay Gatsby\\\\\\'s chaotic life. (Cause, whenever you throw that much money at something, you better be prepared for something to be thrown back.)<br /><br />Overall, <b>I liked this one better</b> the second time around. I\\\\\\'m a bit more familiar with the story, and I have more of a feel for the way Fitzgerald writes.<br /><br />I really enjoy the character of Gatsby this time around and love Daisy a little bit less.<br /><br />The one thing I disliked in round 1 (and have disliked every time I go through this novel) is the language. It just seems...<b>SO over-the-top and flowery. </b><br /><br />It really just takes forever to say anything in this book. Like this: <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>and this:<blockquote>\\\\n  <i>It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.</i>\\\\n</blockquote> AND THIS: <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>Ultimately, this one was not the one for me. Maybe I\\\\\\'ll give it another shot in a couple of years... <br /><br /><a href=\"http://bit.ly/33ii2CT\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">YouTube</a> | <a href=\"http://www.mirandareads.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miranda_reads/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Miranda_Reads\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mirandareads1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a> | Snapchat @miranda_reads</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"10311198840377947191\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review2421742129\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link2421742129\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=2421742129&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_2421742129\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_2421742129\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/2421742129?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">302 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/2421742129?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_2421742129\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/2421742129/comments?reverse=true\">View all 72 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_1608044955\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1608044955\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Luca Ambrosino\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino\"><img alt=\"Luca Ambrosino\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1523134271p2/53478239.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1608044955?book_show_action=true\">Apr 12, 2016</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Luca Ambrosino\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Luca Ambrosino\" href=\"/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino\">Luca Ambrosino</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Hardcover 9788481304879\" href=\"/book/show/10125603-il-grande-gatsby\">review of another edition</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/53478239-luca-ambrosino?shelf=wishlist-others\">wishlist-others</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1608044955\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer8661296813041590770\">English (<a href=\\\\\\'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby\\\\\\' title=\\\\\\'The Great Gatsby by F.

Hmph, so I heard. I suppose it should make one more interested, or at least feel more compelled to read something (or re-read as is the case here) when it has \"classic\" and \"everyone else loves it!\" stamped all over it. And has a movie made out of it, though what beloved novel hasn\\\\\\'t these days? Of course, I originally read FSF\\\\\\'s Gatsby because I was expected to for a high school English class. So, even though I was never the type to do homework, I read The Great Gatsby because it had a neat cover, Fitzgerald is fun to say, and, of course, the legend of Zelda. <br /><br />Unfortunately for Meredyth, my thoughts on Gatsby 10 years ago are pretty similar to the thoughts I have on it today: How pretty. Pretty decedant. How drippy. How zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <br /><br />It\\\\\\'s not that I was completely uninterested. It\\\\\\'s that my interest was never piqued to the point of really giving a shit. Sure, who doesn\\\\\\'t love a hot mysteriously wealthy man with serious heart ache for a serious material girl? What about those rich dudes who may be crooks but no one can figger out how crooked they are exactly because how crooked can you be if you throw such mean hoedowns?! <br /><br />Oh, and I love a good morally ambiguous-protaganist/narrator-who-hates-parties-and-society-but-just-can\\\\\\'t-seem-to-stay-away as much as the next person, but Nick, our hero, just wants to be liked so very much, and unfortunately, he reads like a sap. And when all the other characters are unforgivable bores, I would prefer that my ambiguous, socially mandated narrator manage to keep me awake. <br /><br />What about those three stars? You ask. Well I can\\\\\\'t lie. I do think Fitz had a way with words. I did find that those subtle nuances of the variations in lifestyle during the depression to be very much in effect, and I would be happy to visit any fictional small town called West Egg. Or East Egg for that matter. And I get the kind of crazy he was going for in his more psychopathic character, George Wilson, who, because he was in love, becomes the bastiOn of normalcy even when he is driven to murder and his own suicide. <br /><br />FSF did manage to be believably compassionate towards his seemingly less insane characters, (who are all on the brink of insanity) (but still made me drowsy). There is definitely a part of me that sees how one could be drawn into the twinkly lit world FSF created, supposedly, out of his own reality, and I have noted his passion for the beauty of the unfolding story, such as it is. <br /><br />But I was disappointed 10 years ago by the story\\\\\\'s inability to convince me it wasn\\\\\\'t nap time, its unwillingness to point out the the relevance of the individual over society, and the irrelevance of the world Gatsby inhabits, and I was disappointed again this past week. <br /><br />In summation, be sure to keep an eye out for this writer. Once he writes something more appealing to the masses he\\\\\\'s sure to bust out onto the scene soon. You heard it here first.</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"16473609131059167710\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review11352880\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link11352880\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=11352880&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_11352880\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_11352880\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/11352880?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">244 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/11352880?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_11352880\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/11352880/comments?reverse=true\">View all 46 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_180942465\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/180942465\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Henry Avila\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/5431458-henry-avila\"><img alt=\"Henry Avila\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1307597403p2/5431458.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/180942465?book_show_action=true\">Jun 30, 2011</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Henry Avila\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Henry Avila\" href=\"/user/show/5431458-henry-avila\">Henry Avila</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Library Binding 9781417656639\" href=\"/book/show/396103.The_Great_Gatsby\">review of another edition</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer180942465\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer7452408242361721947\">Jay Gatsby, is a mysterious young man, who gives extravagant parties on Long Island, New York, outside his palatial mansion , in the warm, lazy, summer nights.

That he doesn\\\\\\'t know the people he invites, not to mention the numerous gatecrashers, might make it a little strange, but this being the roaring 20\\\\\\'s, anything goes, rumors abound about Gatsby, bootlegger ? Who cares, as long as the free liquor flows, the great food served, and the beautiful music, continues playing. Finally attending one of his own gatherings, we discover that he\\\\\\'s after Daisy, a lost love, she\\\\\\'s married, which complicates the delicate situation. Nick, Daisy\\\\\\'s cousin, arrives in town and through him, reunites Gatsby with his former girlfriend, she enjoys luxury, which is why Daisy married rich Tom and not poor Jay. A catastrophic car accident kills Tom\\\\\\'s girlfriend, yes, he\\\\\\'s a creep but a wealthy one, it\\\\\\'s vague who\\\\\\'s responsible, but her husband thinks he knows. Death in a swimming pool, ends this tragedy and symbolizes the Jazz Age ... Thoughts: Gatsby was a tortured, lonely man, even shy, who tried to become a member of the establishment. He, with all his riches, needed to enter it, to become part of it, to feel alive but could never remove the dirt and his lowly, and embarrassing origins. They (the upper class), used him and laughed at the stranger behind his back, and the illusions about Daisy , a woman who never really existed, except in his distorted mind. The truth shocked Gatsby, the pretend gentleman but he could never let go of the mirage, if he did, there would be nothing left of his soul.</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"7452408242361721947\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review180942465\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link180942465\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=180942465&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_180942465\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_180942465\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/180942465?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">233 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/180942465?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_180942465\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/180942465/comments?reverse=true\">View all 50 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_6878457\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6878457\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Paul Bryant\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/416390-paul-bryant\"><img alt=\"Paul Bryant\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1224113172p2/416390.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/6878457?book_show_action=true\">Sep 27, 2007</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Paul Bryant\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Paul Bryant\" href=\"/user/show/416390-paul-bryant\">Paul Bryant</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/416390-paul-bryant?shelf=novels\">novels</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer6878457\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer16575770592156573486\">This is an all right-ish kind of novel, I suppose, but I always preferred Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s little-known prequel <i>The Average Gatsby</i>, although some people found the vision of Mervyn Gatsby, Jay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obscure brother, living a reasonably okayish life as the manager of a carpet and upholstery warehouse in Des Moines a trifle dispiriting.

I wonder if it would sell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6 I bet it would. <i>Batgatsby</i>. </span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"16575770592156573486\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review6878457\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link6878457\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=6878457&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_6878457\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_6878457\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/6878457?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">237 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/6878457?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_6878457\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/6878457/comments?reverse=true\">View all 71 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_2888493\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2888493\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Jason\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/180396-jason\"><img alt=\"Jason\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1194484048p2/180396.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/2888493?book_show_action=true\">Jul 09, 2007</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Jason\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Jason\" href=\"/user/show/180396-jason\">Jason</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          <div><span class=\"uitext greyText\">Recommends it for: </span>\\\\n           <span class=\"uitext reviewText\">people who can read</span></div>\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/180396-jason?shelf=favorites\">favorites</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer2888493\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer18400078286759145514\">Most Americans are assigned to read this novel in high school.

Few American high schoolers have the wherewithal to appreciate this novel in full. I certainly did not. It is on a shortlist of novels that should, every 5 years starting at age 25, return to any American\\\\\\'s required reading list.<br /><br />First things first: The opening of The Great Gatsby -- its first 3-4 pages -- ranks among the best of any novel in the English language, and so too does its ending. Both for their content and for their prose, the latter of which is stunning and near perfect throughout the novel.<br /><br />As for that between the novel\\\\\\'s opening and conclusion, two things first. (1) History is fairly clear that the term \"the American Dream\" did not exist at the time Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby, and regardless it almost certainly did not exist in the popular consciousness. (2) Few great American novelists after Fitzgerald have not attempted to write \"the great American novel\". Most of these efforts are absurdly long and often tortured. The Great Gatsby, on the other hand, is relatively short, fluid, and of seemingly effortless yet pristine expression. At a point in history where Fitzgerald\\\\\\'s express focus could hardly have been a tale regarding \"the American dream\" per se or the writing of \"the great American novel\", Fitzgerald nevertheless crafts the definitive tale of \"the American Dream\", as well as, his successors\\\\\\' endeavors aside, \"the great American novel\". Period.<br /><br />In not so many pages, Fitzgerald paints a brilliantly cogent picture of the potential pleasures, joys, and benefits an individual might deem achievable -- uniquely so -- in an America filled with possibilities. Paired with that picture, Fitzgerald besprinkles The Great Gatsby with the numerous pitfalls and evils that both stand as a barrier to what\\\\\\'s imagined achievable in America, and threaten to accompany that which is achieved. Neither the quest for, nor (if possible) the achievement of, the American Dream is a thing untainted. Nor, in Fitzgerald\\\\\\'s view, can it be.<br /><br />Fitzgerald, frankly, writes all that need be written on this subject; whatever his successors\\\\\\' ambitions may be. And he writes it in prose so perfect, so impressive, and so beautiful, I occasionally find myself at a loss to name a novel in the English language constructed with greater skill, and apparent ease thereof.<br /><br />In short: The Great Gatsby is an inimitable wonder of American fiction. And, for lack of a better word, an \"application\" of the English language that has few equals. The novel is astounding.<br /></span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"18400078286759145514\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review2888493\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link2888493\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=2888493&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_2888493\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_2888493\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/2888493?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">226 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/2888493?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_2888493\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/2888493/comments?reverse=true\">View all 20 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_1431343732\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1431343732\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Vit Babenco\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco\"><img alt=\"Vit Babenco\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1365604577p2/19283284.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1431343732?book_show_action=true\">Nov 02, 2015</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Vit Babenco\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Vit Babenco\" href=\"/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco\">Vit Babenco</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Mass Market Paperback 9780553074482\" href=\"/book/show/4679.The_Great_Gatsby\">review of another edition</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1431343732\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer16650506011706497626\">Our fantasies of grandeur are always restricted by our aesthetic tastes and <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is literally an anthem to vulgarity and fraudulence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6<br/><blockquote>But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.

It offers the opportunity to achieve success, prosperity and happiness, regardless of class, status, background or wealth.<br><br>It contains a promise of upward social mobility, a reward that will be ours if we work hard enough.<br><br>We all have an equal opportunity to transcend our current circumstances. <br><br>Implicitly, if we fail to transcend, we have only ourselves to blame. We didn\\\\\\'t take sufficient advantage of our opportunity.

He owns a colossal mansion on West Egg, Long Island. Every week, he holds a lavish party attended by all and sundry. The parties are the ultimate in Jazz Age glamour. <br><br>Gatsby has achieved everything material an American could want. He has realised the Long Island real estate mantra, \"Vocation, Location, Ovation\".<br><br><b>The Green Light</b><br><br>So what\\\\\\'s Gatsby\\\\\\'s problem?<br><br>Every night, Gatsby looks across the sound to a green light on a porch, where Daisy lives in her more prestigious East Egg mansion with her husband, Tom Buchanan.<br><br>Daisy is the one thing for which Gatsby yearns. She is the one thing he has sought after since he met and fell in love with her five years earlier at age 25.<br><br>\"The Great Gatsby\" revers that small green light. What we never see is what Gatsby\\\\\\'s mansion looked like from Daisy\\\\\\'s perspective at home. We aren\\\\\\'t expressly offered a vision of Gatsby\\\\\\'s fully-lit mansion as a counterpoint to Tom\\\\\\'s, but that is what it is.<br><br>The point is Gatsby\\\\\\'s achievement of the Great American Dream was not the end, as it is with most Americans, it was the means to an end, and that end was winning the hand in marriage of Daisy.<br><br>The most important thing about Gatsby\\\\\\'s mansion, from Gatsby\\\\\\'s point of view, is what it would look like to one woman across the sound.<br><br><b>Love\\\\\\'s Labours Retrieved</b><br><br>Gatsby has already lost Daisy once, in 1917, when as a destitute young officer during the war, he was unable to marry her, because he could not offer her a financial security that was acceptable to her wealthy mid-west family.<br><br>Since then, he has acquired wealth, by whatever means necessary, to win her away from Tom and marry her.<br><br>The wealth was nothing to him, the parties were grotesque bonfires of vanity, designed with one thing in mind: to attract Daisy\\\\\\'s attention and bring her, curious, within his reach.<br><br>Then, having got her within his sphere of influence, he could win her back.<br><br>\"The Great Gatsby\" is really about the love a man had for a woman, how he lost it and what he did to regain it.<br><br>At one point, Gatsby talks about repeating the past. I don\\\\\\'t see him as repeating it, so much as regaining it, making up for lost time, retrieving what he felt should have been his.<br><br>\"The Great Gatsby\" is not so much about repetition, as it is about retrieval; not so much a remembrance of things past, as a resumption of a journey from a point in the past when the journey was broken.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379791757i/554412.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"550\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Carey Mulligan as Daisy (Courtesy: The Telegraph)<br><br><b>The Pursuit of Another Man\\\\\\'s Wife</b><br><br>At its heart, Gatsby engages in adultery with Daisy, with a view to convincing her to divorce Tom and marry him.<br><br>Many might find his conduct objectionable, except that he is young, elegant, good-looking, fabulously wealthy and, most importantly, in love with the slender Daisy.<br><br>In contrast, Tom is a brute of a man, he is an ex-champion footballer, hard and cruel. Most importantly, he has cheated on Daisy many times and now has a mistress, the stout, but sensuous, Myrtle Wilson.<br><br>Tom comes from an extremely wealthy mid-western family. Money is no object to him. Daisy might have the voice of money, but Tom has the demeanour and arrogance of not just money, but old money.<br><br>When Tom learns of Daisy\\\\\\'s infidelity and Gatsby\\\\\\'s takeover bid, he goes into typical capitalist mode in order to defend his wife, his asset, his marital property.<br><br>He researches Gatsby\\\\\\'s past and theorises about how he has made his new money. He plans his counter-attack.<br><br>The narrator, Nick Carraway, watches on, not just witness to a battle between Good and Evil, but in reality a battle between two degrees of bad.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379791756i/554395.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"550\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Black and white portrait of Isla Fisher as Myrtle Wilson<br><br><b>Tom\\\\\\'s Defence Strategy</b><br><br>In the realm of love, as between two rival men, there can be no such thing as a friendly takeover bid.<br><br>There is no suggestion that Tom can allow Gatsby to have Daisy, so that he can settle for Myrtle. The latter is just a plaything, something he spends time on, because she is available and he can have her without effort. <br><br>All Myrtle ever wanted from her own husband was a gentleman with breeding. He turns out to be a mere mechanic and car salesman. He doesn\\\\\\'t have the right status. Equally, although he is content to have her as his mistress, Tom doesn\\\\\\'t see Myrtle as having the right status for marriage either.<br><br>Ultimately, the role of marriage is not to perpetuate love and happiness. Tom\\\\\\'s task is to bond together two wealthy establishment families and their riches. A merger of two capitalist families moves them that much closer to monopolistic power, in the same way that the intermarriage of royal families once cemented international power.<br><br>Tom\\\\\\'s goal is so important that it can accommodate his cruelty and infidelities, at least in his eyes.<br><br>Moreover, it allows Tom to prevail over Gatsby, who, despite his war record, his partly-completed Oxford education, his wealth, his glamour, and his apparent achievement of the Great American Dream, is not \"one of us\".<br><br>Ultimately, coincidence, accident and fate intervene on behalf of Tom, almost comically if it was not so sad, and he resists Gatsby\\\\\\'s takeover bid.<br><br>Nick, the observer, the witness, the audience of this tragedy, is left disgusted.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380346064i/700542._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"220\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker<br><br><b>The Great American Paradox</b><br><br>\"The Great Gatsby\" is a short novel. At times, there is more telling than showing. At times, the description is too adjectival or adverbial for the dictates of current style manuals.<br><br>Take away the mansion, the parties and the glamour, and what remains comes close to the dimensions of film noir like \"Double Indemnity\".<br><br>While the novel is perceived as hailing the Great American Dream, the paradox is that it highlights how great are the forces that are lined up to resist the efforts of a man who aspires to the Dream, especially if that man is a trespasser who covets another man\\\\\\'s wife, even if he loves her and she loves him.<br><br>There are flaws in Fitzgerald\\\\\\'s writing, but they are tolerable. The story is magificent, even if, when laid out methodically, it might appear cliched. The characters, while realistic, are detailed and larger than life, certainly detailed enough to withstand the scrutiny when they are projected onto the silver screen. They are portrayed acting out their emotions in exactly the same way that we might in the same circumstances.<br><br>However, in the long run, what makes \"The Great Gatsby\" great is Fitzgerald\\\\\\'s ability to both adulate and perpetuate the Great American Dream, while simultaneously subverting it.</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"1191735107149378655\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review150030209\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link150030209\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=150030209&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_150030209\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_150030209\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/150030209?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">202 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/150030209?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_150030209\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/150030209/comments?reverse=true\">View all 153 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_2076161679\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2076161679\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Jennifer Masterson\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson\"><img alt=\"Jennifer Masterson\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1600995952p2/28953843.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/2076161679?book_show_action=true\">Jul 31, 2017</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Jennifer Masterson\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Jennifer Masterson\" href=\"/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson\">Jennifer Masterson</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Audible Audio \" href=\"/book/show/17793119-the-great-gatsby\">review of another edition</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/28953843-jennifer-masterson?shelf=classics\">classics</a>, \\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/28953843-jennifer-masterson?shelf=2017\">2017</a>, \\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/28953843-jennifer-masterson?shelf=audio\">audio</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer2076161679\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer2041299394901733487\">I just spent three days being read to by Jake Gyllenhaal and it was absolutely wonderful!

I did it on audio this time, headed out to listen to it (double time) on a walk yesterday, and 8.6 miles later I had listened to the whole thing straight through!<br><br>So glad I gave this one another shot. It\\\\\\'s pretty good - definitely worthy of 5 stars. If you remember it poorly because of a required reading experience, I think it is worth revisiting.<br><br>Here is my original review from January 8th, 2013:<br><br>When I first reviewed this on Goodreads, I gave it 1 star. I just did not remember enjoying it as required reading in High School.<br><br>Then I went through a phase a couple of years ago where I read a lot of Hemingway and about Hemingway (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8683812.The_Paris_Wife\" title=\"The Paris Wife by Paula McLain\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Paris Wife</a>), and with Hemingway you get a lot of Fitzgerald.<br><br>Shortly after that, the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio came out and my wife\\\\\\'s book club read the book. We ended up discussing the book for hours and watched the movie. After that I had to change my rating.<br><br>I only brought it up to 3 because it is still not one of my favorites, but I get it more now (update August 2020 - now 5 stars!). There is a whole lot of interesting content packed into an under 200 page book (how they made a 2 1/2 hour movie, I\\\\\\'ll never know - but they kept it pretty close to the source material). I also think this book is very representative of the time period and the type of writing you were seeing in the \"Jazz Age\". Because of this, it is an important piece of literature.</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"5049263465674634457\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review500797282\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link500797282\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=500797282&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_500797282\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_500797282\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/500797282?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">202 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/500797282?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_500797282\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/500797282/comments?reverse=true\">View all 18 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div id=\"comment_225108958\" class=\"brown_comment\">\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\\\\n    \\\\t<a alt=\"Matthew\" href=\"/user/show/16254355-matthew\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1464987365p1/16254355.jpg\" alt=\"16254355\" /></a>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\\\\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/16254355-matthew\">Matthew</a>\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer2344326619202634667\"><i>Ginger wrote: &quot;Hahaha!!

All very glamorous, self-centred, and shallow, but the possibility of darker things lurking holds interest and tension. <br /><br />CHARACTERS<br />Even if you like celebrity parties, there are no good, pleasant characters; it may start off glamourising such lives, but things are very different by the end. \"They were careless people... they smashed up things and creations and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\" (This even applies to children: only one is ever mentioned, but is then oddly forgotten, perhaps reflecting the sadness of how irrelevant she is to everyone.)<br /><br /><b>Nick</b>, the narrator, is the odd one out in that he actually has to work for a living. Also, perhaps because he nurses a secret <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[is he in love with Gatsby, or merely dazzled by him <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>? <br /><br />Nick is also the most honest and honourable one (or perhaps the least dishonest and dishonourable, though the fact he explicitly mentions his reputation for honesty (more than once) does bring Lady Macbeth to mind). He reconnects with his cousin, Daisy, who is married to Tom, and dips his toe in their social set. Always the outsider, yet somehow inside, and thus surely culpable for things that happen, at least to some extent.<br /><br /><b>Daisy</b> is perhaps the most significant character, though more words are written about others. Her name is unlikely to be a coincidence: daisies are robust and wild; they don\\\\\\'t need or want hothouse pampering - despite appearances to the contrary. <br /><br />The host with the most is the mysterious Jay <b>Gatsby</b>, who throws lavish parties for people he barely knows (albeit with an ulterior motive). Like all the main characters, he is a westerner who moved east. Nick (and therefore Fitzgerald) seems to think this is significant, though as a Brit, it is somewhat lost on me. <br /><br />ARTIFICE<br />Some people see through the artifice: \"She was appalled by West Egg [the village], this unprecedented \\\\\\'place\\\\\\' that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village - appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing.\"<br /><br />RELEVANCE TODAY<br />Americans often have strong feelings about this book because of the way it explores (and, initially at least, admires) The American Dream. However, as a modern Brit, with no emotional attachment to the concept, it still feels relevant. <br /><br />The message is about the power - and danger - of chasing dreams, without giving thought to the wider ramifications. Extravagance and superficiality lose their lustre after a while. Perhaps the \"celebrities\" who currently fill the pages of glossy magazines such as Hello and OK should take note: there are many similarities. <br /><br />Or maybe it\\\\\\'s about the overwhelming force of love - its costs and consequences - and the pain that hope bestows. Especially secret, forbidden love. <br /><br />Can you be true to yourself, or one you love, if you are dishonest in other realms?<br /><br />There are some wonderful descriptions and images:<br /><br />* One such couple \"drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together\".<br />* At times, it is almost Wildean, \"I drove... to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all\" and \"I like large parties. they\\\\\\'re so intimate. At small parties there isn\\\\\\'t any privacy.\"<br />* \"It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.\"<br />* Chat that \"was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire\".<br />* \"The last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face... then the glow faded, each light deserting her with a lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\"<br />* \"Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.\"<br />* \"trousers of a nebulous hue\"<br />* \"the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor\"<br />* \"Drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace... these reveries... were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy\\\\\\'s wing.\"<br />* Regarding a college, \"dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny\".<br />* \"his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears\"<br /><br /><br />There were also a couple of startlingly awkward phrases, one on the first page. No one is perfect, but given how much Fitzgerald is lauded for the perfection of his writing, they surprised me:<br /><br />* \"just remember that <b>all</b> the people in this world <b>haven\\\\\\'t</b> had the advantages that you\\\\\\'ve had.\"<br />* \"A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, <b>endowing with complete isolation the figure</b> of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in an informal gesture of farewell.\"<br /><br />Also, is \"the day... was pouring rain\" (not \"with rain\") common in American English?</span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"8421377784720815636\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));;

I prefer the Victorian and pre-Victorian Classics and Modern Classics have never really interested me. However, even before I began this Reading Challenge I knew that I needed to change that. I\\\\\\'m still not overly enamoured with Modern Classics (though they tend to be a lot shorter than Victorian Classics are, which can come as a relief) but I am thoroughly enjoying the journey through the genre.<br /><br />This book was quite a disappointment and not a surprise at the same time. I knew I wasn\\\\\\'t going to love it before I went in to it, though I don\\\\\\'t know why. I had no preconceptions of this book: I\\\\\\'ve never seen the film and I haven\\\\\\'t ever read a blurb about it. My copy doesn\\\\\\'t have one. I just knew I wouldn\\\\\\'t love it.<br /><br />I didn\\\\\\'t think I wouldn\\\\\\'t like it, though. I can\\\\\\'t really think of any specifics, I just didn\\\\\\'t like the plot, the characters or the setting at all. There were some fun moments, some dire moments and just a whole lot of dullness going around. It\\\\\\'s hard to really enjoy something if you don\\\\\\'t feel any sympathy or empathy with the characters, not even mentioning that ever-present idea that we need to identify with characters, too. I also found that this book wasn\\\\\\'t particularly American, or particularly 20s, or particularly anything at all, really. It was just a kind of story with a kind of moral to it.<br /><br />The one thing I will say about this: F. Scott is a wonderful writer. I kind of thought this before I went in, but I never really knew until I found I was re-reading sentences over and over again just to re-live them. Not what they were saying, or what they were telling, or showing, or portraying, or anything like that, but just the words used and in which order. Sometimes it felt like magic. I will definitely read more F. Scott, but this one really isn\\\\\\'t great at all. But that\\\\\\'s okay.

The characters themselves seem shallow and empty, lacking in morality and you could take all this into consideration and instantly report: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98well that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a shallow book if ever I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 However it can also be seen that, The Great Gatsby is a scathing social commentary that explores the fruitlessness of pursuing dreams. Particularly dreams that are nothing more than shadows. To that end The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of fiction designed to criticise the lack of morality among its rich and selfish inhabitants who parasitically devour the work of the poor.<br /><br />One of the most beautiful elements in this novel is the depiction of the Valley of Ashes, which ultimately all the characters pass through regardless of being rich or poor. It is a place of equality and reminds one of the idea of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Valley of the Shadow of Death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mentioned by the Psalmist David, and in the novel itself Wilson relates those giant eyes to the eyes of God, a God who sees all that men do. Which is such a brilliant image to present to the reader. It is imagery like this that haunts one far after finishing this novel. Imagery remembered emphatically.<br /><br />It is also the language of Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work that draws one in. It may not always be flawless writing but it is vivid and alive. Fitzgerald\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s is essentially thoughtful writing. It is the language of quotes that act as prison bars to keep the reader enthralled by the novel.<br /><br />\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been turning over in my mind ever since.<br />\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he told me, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98just remember that all the people in this world haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had the advantages that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<br /><br />Of course The Great Gatsby will always be a polarising text due to its characters and the debate about whether it is truly a novel about the American Dream. It is a polarising effect that stems from the allure of the book \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the way in which the novel hauntingly hints at something greater while remaining so brilliantly flawed. One certainly cannot fully explain their own fascination with the book, save that it does that rare thing that strong literature should do. It serves, as Franz Kafka said, to be \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe axe for the frozen sea within us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d An axe in a forest of frozen dreams \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 poetically carving up a vision of one man forever haunted by the failings of his own dream.<br /><br /><b>The rest of this review has been moved over to my website, <a href=\"http://jonathanterrington.com/why-is-the-great-gatsby-great-a-review-of-f-scott-fitzgeralds-classic-novel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"></a> click right here if you would like to read the rest of the review.</b></span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\"2562877364726071980\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\\\n\\\\n          </span>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review213835311\">\\\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link213835311\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=213835311&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">flag</a>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      <span class=\\\\\\'likeItContainer\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'like_container_review_213835311\\\\\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_213835311\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/213835311?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">162 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F4671.The_Great_Gatsby\">Like</a></span>\\\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/213835311?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\\'comments_for_review_213835311\\\\\\' style=\\\\\\'display: none;\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'brown_comment\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/213835311/comments?reverse=true\">View all 55 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n  </td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n<div id=\"review_133726757\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/133726757\" />\\\\n    <a title=\"Emily May\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4622890-emily-may\"><img alt=\"Emily May\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1528390751p2/4622890.jpg\" /></a>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/133726757?book_show_action=true\">Dec 05, 2010</a>\\\\n\\\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\\\n        <a title=\"Emily May\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Emily May\" href=\"/user/show/4622890-emily-may\">Emily May</a>\\\\n      </span>\\\\n\\\\n        rated it\\\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\\\n            Shelves:\\\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4622890-emily-may?shelf=classics\">classics</a>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer133726757\" class=\"readable\"\\\\n              >\\\\n            \\\\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer10827409173554467527\"><b>Update Nov, 2019:</b> Well, I knew I would like this better when I *finally* got around to reading it again.<br/><br/>***<br/>Let&apos;s just call this a &quot;need to reread&quot; book.

Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"14228121656560011061\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJ.D. Salinger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s and 60\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"15359045026284283500\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s prescience of modern life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"10541772482221850922\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. \\\\\\\\nWhen Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"4823225745854054555\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

Jane Austen called this brilliant work &quot;her own darling child&quot; and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, &quot;as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.&quot; The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"5108003695713834546\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

His parents are dead and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThough Harry\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFull of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"4840565924166027053\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender.

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe end of innocence, the darkness of man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"3264642352565051834\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\\\\\\\\n--back cover<\\\\\\\\/span>\\\\\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\\\\\"16983238230142032993\\\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\\\\\$(this));;

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMinny, Aibileen\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s business, but she can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mind her tongue, so she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSeemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another.

(Fun fact: my first read of this took place in the back of the family minivan when I was 13, on a roadtrip to, like, Disney World or something. While thoughts of princesses and mouse-shaped ice cream bars danced in my siblings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 heads, I was reading about moral corruption in the Jazz Age.) (All because I saw online that if a college interviewer asks what your favorite book is, you should say The Great Gatsby. And for some goddamn reason, I was like, <i>Yeah, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s definitely urgent that I, an eighth grade student, be prepared to have a college interview at any moment.</i>) (I only ever had to do one college interview anyway, because only one was required and of COURSE I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t opt into the non-mandatory ones because CANYOUIMAGINE. Guess what? The interviewer did ask me what my favorite book was. Guess what I <i>didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say?</i> The Great f*ckin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gatsby! I panicked and, I think, said <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>, because it was the first non-embarrassing book that came to mind. My life is just one mistake after another.)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1433609312ra/15119965.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Anyway. I loved Daisy then. I loved her two years later, when my English class read it and it was VERY clear that I was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csupposed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to not like her, and, like, fawn over Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s childish ass instead. Which, no. Picture this: fifteen-year-old me, who has Just Decided she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be cool now (a process which involved wearing 15 layers of mascara and <i>no other makeup</i> - neither an exaggeration nor a good look) in a room of twenty fifteen-year-olds, including cool ones, all VEHEMENTLY AGREEING ON SOMETHING.<br><br>But I still stood up for Daisy. Because I have PRIORITIES.<br><br>My senior year of high school, my morals and soul and ability to empathize were challenged by six students and a teacher in AP Lit. But I won the award for being the best English student in my graduating class, so honestly I think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an indication that I also won that argument. <br><br>And now here I am today, prepared to make the same argument to you all.<br><br>And win.<br><br><i>Obviously.</i><br><br>But let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get into this. Here is why Daisy is not only innocent to the VILLAINOUS charges that have been placed upon her, but also the best character in this book and an absolute angel/joy/gift from the heavens. (Does that mean F. Scott Fitzgerald is God?)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1475834753ra/20771360.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Also, this has literally all of the spoilers. And is long. But THOROUGH AND WORTH IT. <s>Maybe.</s><br><br><br><b>One: What was she SUPPOSED to do?</b><br><br>So put yaself in Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes, yeah? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s take it allllll the way back. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a teenage girl who is the hottest sh*t in all of Louisville. (This is a big deal, apparently.) You have SIX DATES A DAY! The phone never stops ringing!!! You have nothing but options!!<br><br>Kidding, kidding. You only have one option, really, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marrying a rich guy. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we <i>love</i> historical gender expectations? I know I do!<br><br>So then one day, this guy who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fiiiiine as hell shows up. And you guys start hanging out all the time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so charming and hot and you guys get along like a house on fire. You have a really great kiss. The guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a captain in the army, and he implies he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supes well off financially. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perfect. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best case scenario for you.<br><br>(This guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jay Gatsby, by the way. In case I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t made that clear.)<br><br>Then the guy has to go off to war. It sucks, sucks, sucks. You two write letters back and forth, but all the while your family is pressuring you. Society is pressuring you. Your friends are making backhanded comments about how you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re still unmarried.<br><br>The war ends. Sweet relief! Jay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming home!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746761ra/23592278.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Except no. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at Oxford, for some reason? And he tells you he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come home? And your letters get sadder and sadder, because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of time. The war ended, and you have nothing to tell your parents.<br><br>So those six dates a day start back up.<br><br>And then this guy pops up in town. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s reallyyyy rich. And buff. And a real society man. And he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not from Louisville - he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a way out. You can see the world with him. Best of all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obsessed with you.<br><br>(This guy is Tom Buchanan.)<br><br>So what do you do? You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. You have to marry him.<br><br>And when you get a letter from Jay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cToo Little Too Late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gatsby, you scream and cry and try to stop the wedding, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing you can do. Ya hafta marry Tom \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems Okay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Buchanan.<br><br><br><b>Two: Now That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s What I Call \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhoops\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</b><br><br>The OTHER fun thing you get to do, in this life as Daisy Buchanan, is have children whether you want them or not.<br><br>For awhile you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind Tom. In fact, you really love him for a bit. He does nice stuff like carry you so your shoes don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch the ground, and the honeymoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great, etc etc. So even though you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have one mother-effin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ounce of an option in whether you want kids or not, when ya get pregnant, you think maybe it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be that bad.<br><br>And then Tom turns out to <i>suuuuuck.</i> You have to leave these places you love, where everyone is full-on obsessed with you, and you have friends and family and as close to a life as you can get, you have to leave because Tom is f*cking everything with girl parts and a ditzy 1920s accent.<br><br>BUT NOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WILL BE FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU. And all you can hope is that she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be a beautiful fool, like Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s girls, so she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be silly enough to be satisfied with life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inability to give her much of anything.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746621ra/23592268.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And Daisy might be beautiful, but she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sure as sh*t no fool.<br><br><br><b>Three: Ho-ly shit wait...does life not suck? Is there such a thing as a second chance?</b><br><br>So you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this new life in New York, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a BFF from Louisville (Jordan Baker), and yes, Tom is cheating on you, but if he maybe just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer the goddamn phone during dinner for once you could just forget about it for literally one freaking second.<br><br>And then GUESS WHAT? Your old pal Nick Carraway is back! A friend, how amazing! HURRAY! And kinda strange, Nick wants you to get a weird one-on-one tea party on with him, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, whatever, Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheating anyway and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not interested in Nick like that but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fun guy and you can just reject him.<br><br>But waitholdupWHOA what a wild coincidence! The guy who was lowkey the love of your life, Jay Gatsby, is also here! How, well, coincidental! You can play catch up and see his bougie-ass house and whatnot. And cry over the fact that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such a horrific asshole that he would leave you totally in the dust without contacting you for years and then all of a sudden appears and is like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very rich as promised I live right across the water from you I can see your house let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get together here are all my fancy shirts I will throw them at you. So glad Nick is here for some reason let\\\\\\'s keep on not letting him leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<br><br>Plus life with Tom, as mentioned, is not extremely great.<br><br>So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, yeah, perfect, okay. Let\\\\\\'s get some Gatsby on.<br><br><br><b>Four: No. No, there is not a chance of life not sucking. Life is terrible and so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into a gUY WHO IS JUST AS BAD.</b><br><br>GUESS WHAT WASN\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T A COINCIDENCE? ANY OF THAT. All along, even the people you trusted most - Nick, Jordan, Gatsby - have been manipulating you. There have been secret plans and lies and tricks and all of these things just to get you to f*ck a guy.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746920ra/23592294.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And if you think about it, Gatsby is not nice or romantic or kind or fair to lil ol Daisy. At all. His expectations are insane. He got to leave her and build a life for himself and live as he wanted and travel and make up this story and be wealthy and throw parties, while she lived with a cheating husband. And after all that, if she wants admission into the life that being with him might give her, she has to say no, she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever happy, there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a moment she loved Tom.<br><br>Ridiculous.<br><br>And when she plaintively says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI love you now. Isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that enough? I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help the past,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just begging Gatsby to accept her. How absolutely tragic. Tom cheats on her, Gatsby expects so much - she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never been fully, truly, without-exception loved.<br><br><br><b>Five: Gatsby literally sucks oh my god</b><br><br>DAISY IS JUST A SYMBOL OF GATSBY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S ABILITY TO CONQUER THE SOCIOECONOMIC CASTE SYSTEM OF THE 1920S. Like, if he can \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Daisy (literally an object), that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not even enough. He has to have HAD DAISY FOREVER. Because then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beaten Tom, the symbol of old money. <br><br>He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so gross, literally. Here are 2 quotes on Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfeelings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for Daisy which illustrate how much he sucks.<br><br><i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy. It increased her value in his eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>Her VALUE. Like she is an OBJECT. Because OTHER MEN were not enough, so he is THE BEST MAN. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747101ra/23592309.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Daisy must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve fallen short of <i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can think up in his ghostly heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>So he made her into this manic-pixie-dream IDEA of a person, and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be mad at <i>her</i> for not living up to it? Nah. Nope. Not going to happen. Gatsby sucks.<br><br><br><b>Six: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the responsible choice, you raging dingbats</b><br><br>So AFTER she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already been pressured by Gatsby to act as though entire swaths of her life didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen, she finds out Gatsby has been lying to her all along - keeping the truth from her in order to protect this psychotic fairytale concoction of a totally goddamn made up story. Like! A! Total! Freak! What the f*ck would you do? If you were going to leave your sh*tty gross husband for what seems like a better life, but really has always been a lie - and a totally full on creepy one at that. And what if you had a daughter, who it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR you love and worry about and she loves you too, so much. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just leave her in the care of that sh*tty creepy cheating disgusting husband, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care less and would not be at all above using her as a chess piece??? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave her when everything you thought you knew was completely made up???? When it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been your dearest loved ones manipulating you all along???<br><br>No, the f*ck you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s choices were protecting her daughter, and sexy times with a con man. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no goddamn choice.<br><br>She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great and smart and responsible. It couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been easy for her to stay with Tom, who SUCKS. She says to his face that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crepulsive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But it was the grown-up option.<br><br>TALK ABOUT A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. She is such a queen.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746621ra/23592271.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br><br><b>Seven: Oh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, I forgot THE LAW THAT MARRIED COUPLES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN LEVELS OF BAD-NESS you fools</b><br><br>Tom sucks. We know this. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a racist cheating bastard, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gross, and he hits Myrtle. He does plenty a\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terrible thing.<br><br>But guess who is not automatically responsible for his actions??? Daisy, b*tch. She totally roasts him up for his <i>Rise of the Colored Empires</i> pseudo-science racism. She simply does not treat people in the same way Tom does. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not him. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the grouping of them both together like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s her fault. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s totally trapped.<br><br><br><b>Eight: Do we know that she knows that Gatsby died? Do we really, really, reallyyyyy know?</b><br><br>When Nick calls her house, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. Like, do we honestlyyyyyy think that the dude who picked up the phone is actually going to tell her he called? Would you be rearing to go if a person you trusted who TOTALLY ACTUALLY MANIPULATED YOU hit you up after ignoring you for weeks like YOU ARE THE VILLAIN?<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747690ra/23592348.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Honestly, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no real sign that Daisy knew he died, but literally what did she owe him anyway. He manipulated her, lied to her, treated her like an object and nearly ruined her life. Totally made a terrible existence into full on garb\\\\xc3\\\\xa0ge. Whatever, man.<br><br><br><b>Nine: The car thing</b><br><br>She was traumatized. Gatsby orchestrated the whole cover-up. <i>He</i> took the wheel, <i>he</i> drove away, <i>he</i> hid the car. She had no clue the whole thing would go horribly wrong. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the one who made all the choices in the aftermath. Duh.<br><br><br><br><br>God this was so long.

While thoughts of princesses and mouse-shaped ice cream bars danced in my siblings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 heads, I was reading about moral corruption in the Jazz Age.) (All because I saw online that if a college interviewer asks what your favorite book is, you should say The Great Gatsby. And for some goddamn reason, I was like, <i>Yeah, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s definitely urgent that I, an eighth grade student, be prepared to have a college interview at any moment.</i>) (I only ever had to do one college interview anyway, because only one was required and of COURSE I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t opt into the non-mandatory ones because CANYOUIMAGINE. Guess what? The interviewer did ask me what my favorite book was. Guess what I <i>didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say?</i> The Great f*ckin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gatsby! I panicked and, I think, said <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>, because it was the first non-embarrassing book that came to mind. My life is just one mistake after another.)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1433609312ra/15119965.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Anyway. I loved Daisy then. I loved her two years later, when my English class read it and it was VERY clear that I was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csupposed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to not like her, and, like, fawn over Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s childish ass instead. Which, no. Picture this: fifteen-year-old me, who has Just Decided she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be cool now (a process which involved wearing 15 layers of mascara and <i>no other makeup</i> - neither an exaggeration nor a good look) in a room of twenty fifteen-year-olds, including cool ones, all VEHEMENTLY AGREEING ON SOMETHING.<br><br>But I still stood up for Daisy. Because I have PRIORITIES.<br><br>My senior year of high school, my morals and soul and ability to empathize were challenged by six students and a teacher in AP Lit. But I won the award for being the best English student in my graduating class, so honestly I think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an indication that I also won that argument. <br><br>And now here I am today, prepared to make the same argument to you all.<br><br>And win.<br><br><i>Obviously.</i><br><br>But let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get into this. Here is why Daisy is not only innocent to the VILLAINOUS charges that have been placed upon her, but also the best character in this book and an absolute angel/joy/gift from the heavens. (Does that mean F. Scott Fitzgerald is God?)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1475834753ra/20771360.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Also, this has literally all of the spoilers. And is long. But THOROUGH AND WORTH IT. <s>Maybe.</s><br><br><br><b>One: What was she SUPPOSED to do?</b><br><br>So put yaself in Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes, yeah? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s take it allllll the way back. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a teenage girl who is the hottest sh*t in all of Louisville. (This is a big deal, apparently.) You have SIX DATES A DAY! The phone never stops ringing!!! You have nothing but options!!<br><br>Kidding, kidding. You only have one option, really, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marrying a rich guy. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we <i>love</i> historical gender expectations? I know I do!<br><br>So then one day, this guy who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fiiiiine as hell shows up. And you guys start hanging out all the time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so charming and hot and you guys get along like a house on fire. You have a really great kiss. The guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a captain in the army, and he implies he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supes well off financially. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perfect. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best case scenario for you.<br><br>(This guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jay Gatsby, by the way. In case I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t made that clear.)<br><br>Then the guy has to go off to war. It sucks, sucks, sucks. You two write letters back and forth, but all the while your family is pressuring you. Society is pressuring you. Your friends are making backhanded comments about how you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re still unmarried.<br><br>The war ends. Sweet relief! Jay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming home!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746761ra/23592278.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Except no. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at Oxford, for some reason? And he tells you he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come home? And your letters get sadder and sadder, because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of time. The war ended, and you have nothing to tell your parents.<br><br>So those six dates a day start back up.<br><br>And then this guy pops up in town. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s reallyyyy rich. And buff. And a real society man. And he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not from Louisville - he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a way out. You can see the world with him. Best of all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obsessed with you.<br><br>(This guy is Tom Buchanan.)<br><br>So what do you do? You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. You have to marry him.<br><br>And when you get a letter from Jay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cToo Little Too Late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gatsby, you scream and cry and try to stop the wedding, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing you can do. Ya hafta marry Tom \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems Okay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Buchanan.<br><br><br><b>Two: Now That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s What I Call \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhoops\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</b><br><br>The OTHER fun thing you get to do, in this life as Daisy Buchanan, is have children whether you want them or not.<br><br>For awhile you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind Tom. In fact, you really love him for a bit. He does nice stuff like carry you so your shoes don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch the ground, and the honeymoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great, etc etc. So even though you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have one mother-effin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ounce of an option in whether you want kids or not, when ya get pregnant, you think maybe it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be that bad.<br><br>And then Tom turns out to <i>suuuuuck.</i> You have to leave these places you love, where everyone is full-on obsessed with you, and you have friends and family and as close to a life as you can get, you have to leave because Tom is f*cking everything with girl parts and a ditzy 1920s accent.<br><br>BUT NOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WILL BE FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU. And all you can hope is that she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be a beautiful fool, like Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s girls, so she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be silly enough to be satisfied with life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inability to give her much of anything.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746621ra/23592268.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And Daisy might be beautiful, but she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sure as sh*t no fool.<br><br><br><b>Three: Ho-ly shit wait...does life not suck? Is there such a thing as a second chance?</b><br><br>So you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this new life in New York, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a BFF from Louisville (Jordan Baker), and yes, Tom is cheating on you, but if he maybe just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer the goddamn phone during dinner for once you could just forget about it for literally one freaking second.<br><br>And then GUESS WHAT? Your old pal Nick Carraway is back! A friend, how amazing! HURRAY! And kinda strange, Nick wants you to get a weird one-on-one tea party on with him, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, whatever, Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheating anyway and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not interested in Nick like that but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fun guy and you can just reject him.<br><br>But waitholdupWHOA what a wild coincidence! The guy who was lowkey the love of your life, Jay Gatsby, is also here! How, well, coincidental! You can play catch up and see his bougie-ass house and whatnot. And cry over the fact that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such a horrific asshole that he would leave you totally in the dust without contacting you for years and then all of a sudden appears and is like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very rich as promised I live right across the water from you I can see your house let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get together here are all my fancy shirts I will throw them at you. So glad Nick is here for some reason let\\\\\\'s keep on not letting him leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d<br><br>Plus life with Tom, as mentioned, is not extremely great.<br><br>So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, yeah, perfect, okay. Let\\\\\\'s get some Gatsby on.<br><br><br><b>Four: No. No, there is not a chance of life not sucking. Life is terrible and so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into a gUY WHO IS JUST AS BAD.</b><br><br>GUESS WHAT WASN\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T A COINCIDENCE? ANY OF THAT. All along, even the people you trusted most - Nick, Jordan, Gatsby - have been manipulating you. There have been secret plans and lies and tricks and all of these things just to get you to f*ck a guy.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502746920ra/23592294.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>And if you think about it, Gatsby is not nice or romantic or kind or fair to lil ol Daisy. At all. His expectations are insane. He got to leave her and build a life for himself and live as he wanted and travel and make up this story and be wealthy and throw parties, while she lived with a cheating husband. And after all that, if she wants admission into the life that being with him might give her, she has to say no, she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever happy, there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a moment she loved Tom.<br><br>Ridiculous.<br><br>And when she plaintively says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI love you now. Isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that enough? I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help the past,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just begging Gatsby to accept her. How absolutely tragic. Tom cheats on her, Gatsby expects so much - she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never been fully, truly, without-exception loved.<br><br><br><b>Five: Gatsby literally sucks oh my god</b><br><br>DAISY IS JUST A SYMBOL OF GATSBY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S ABILITY TO CONQUER THE SOCIOECONOMIC CASTE SYSTEM OF THE 1920S. Like, if he can \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Daisy (literally an object), that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not even enough. He has to have HAD DAISY FOREVER. Because then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beaten Tom, the symbol of old money. <br><br>He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so gross, literally. Here are 2 quotes on Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfeelings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for Daisy which illustrate how much he sucks.<br><br><i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy. It increased her value in his eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>Her VALUE. Like she is an OBJECT. Because OTHER MEN were not enough, so he is THE BEST MAN. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502747101ra/23592309.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Daisy must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve fallen short of <i>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can think up in his ghostly heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d</i><br><br>So he made her into this manic-pixie-dream IDEA of a person, and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be mad at <i>her</i> for not living up to it? Nah. Nope. Not going to happen. Gatsby sucks.<br><br><br><b>Six: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the responsible choice, you raging dingbats</b><br><br>So AFTER she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already been pressured by Gatsby to act as though entire swaths of her life didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen, she finds out Gatsby has been lying to her all along - keeping the truth from her in order to protect this psychotic fairytale concoction of a totally goddamn made up story. Like! A! Total! Freak! What the f*ck would you do? If you were going to leave your sh*tty gross husband for what seems like a better life, but really has always been a lie - and a totally full on creepy one at that.

(Fun fact: my first read of this took place in the back of the family minivan when I was 13, on a roadtrip to, like, Disney World or something. While thoughts of princesses and mouse-shaped ice cream bars danced in my siblings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 heads, I was reading about moral corruption in the Jazz Age.) (All because I saw online that if a college interviewer asks what your favorite book is, you should say The Great Gatsby. And for some goddamn reason, I was like, Yeah, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s definitely urgent that I, an eighth grade student, be prepared to have a college interview at any moment.) (I only ever had to do one college interview anyway, because only one was required and of COURSE I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t opt into the non-mandatory ones because CANYOUIMAGINE. Guess what? The interviewer did ask me what my favorite book was. Guess what I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say? The Great f*ckin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gatsby! I panicked and, I think, said All the Light We Cannot See, because it was the first non-embarrassing book that came to mind. My life is just one mistake after another.)Anyway. I loved Daisy then. I loved her two years later, when my English class read it and it was VERY clear that I was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csupposed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to not like her, and, like, fawn over Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s childish ass instead. Which, no. Picture this: fifteen-year-old me, who has Just Decided she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be cool now (a process which involved wearing 15 layers of mascara and no other makeup - neither an exaggeration nor a good look) in a room of twenty fifteen-year-olds, including cool ones, all VEHEMENTLY AGREEING ON SOMETHING.But I still stood up for Daisy. Because I have PRIORITIES.My senior year of high school, my morals and soul and ability to empathize were challenged by six students and a teacher in AP Lit. But I won the award for being the best English student in my graduating class, so honestly I think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an indication that I also won that argument. And now here I am today, prepared to make the same argument to you all.And win.Obviously.But let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get into this. Here is why Daisy is not only innocent to the VILLAINOUS charges that have been placed upon her, but also the best character in this book and an absolute angel/joy/gift from the heavens. (Does that mean F. Scott Fitzgerald is God?)Also, this has literally all of the spoilers. And is long. But THOROUGH AND WORTH IT. Maybe.One: What was she SUPPOSED to do?So put yaself in Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes, yeah? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s take it allllll the way back. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a teenage girl who is the hottest sh*t in all of Louisville. (This is a big deal, apparently.) You have SIX DATES A DAY! The phone never stops ringing!!! You have nothing but options!!Kidding, kidding. You only have one option, really, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marrying a rich guy. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we love historical gender expectations? I know I do!So then one day, this guy who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fiiiiine as hell shows up. And you guys start hanging out all the time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so charming and hot and you guys get along like a house on fire. You have a really great kiss. The guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a captain in the army, and he implies he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supes well off financially. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perfect. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best case scenario for you.(This guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Jay Gatsby, by the way. In case I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t made that clear.)Then the guy has to go off to war. It sucks, sucks, sucks. You two write letters back and forth, but all the while your family is pressuring you. Society is pressuring you. Your friends are making backhanded comments about how you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re still unmarried.The war ends. Sweet relief! Jay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming home!Except no. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at Oxford, for some reason? And he tells you he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come home? And your letters get sadder and sadder, because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of time. The war ended, and you have nothing to tell your parents.So those six dates a day start back up.And then this guy pops up in town. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s reallyyyy rich. And buff. And a real society man. And he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not from Louisville - he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a way out. You can see the world with him. Best of all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obsessed with you.(This guy is Tom Buchanan.)So what do you do? You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. You have to marry him.And when you get a letter from Jay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cToo Little Too Late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gatsby, you scream and cry and try to stop the wedding, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing you can do. Ya hafta marry Tom \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems Okay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Buchanan.Two: Now That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s What I Call \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhoops\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dThe OTHER fun thing you get to do, in this life as Daisy Buchanan, is have children whether you want them or not.For awhile you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind Tom. In fact, you really love him for a bit. He does nice stuff like carry you so your shoes don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch the ground, and the honeymoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great, etc etc. So even though you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have one mother-effin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ounce of an option in whether you want kids or not, when ya get pregnant, you think maybe it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be that bad.And then Tom turns out to suuuuuck. You have to leave these places you love, where everyone is full-on obsessed with you, and you have friends and family and as close to a life as you can get, you have to leave because Tom is f*cking everything with girl parts and a ditzy 1920s accent.BUT NOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WILL BE FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU. And all you can hope is that she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be a beautiful fool, like Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s girls, so she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be silly enough to be satisfied with life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inability to give her much of anything.And Daisy might be beautiful, but she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sure as sh*t no fool.Three: Ho-ly shit wait...does life not suck? Is there such a thing as a second chance?So you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this new life in New York, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a BFF from Louisville (Jordan Baker), and yes, Tom is cheating on you, but if he maybe just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer the goddamn phone during dinner for once you could just forget about it for literally one freaking second.And then GUESS WHAT? Your old pal Nick Carraway is back! A friend, how amazing! HURRAY! And kinda strange, Nick wants you to get a weird one-on-one tea party on with him, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, whatever, Tom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheating anyway and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not interested in Nick like that but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fun guy and you can just reject him.But waitholdupWHOA what a wild coincidence! The guy who was lowkey the love of your life, Jay Gatsby, is also here! How, well, coincidental! You can play catch up and see his bougie-ass house and whatnot. And cry over the fact that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such a horrific asshole that he would leave you totally in the dust without contacting you for years and then all of a sudden appears and is like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very rich as promised I live right across the water from you I can see your house let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get together here are all my fancy shirts I will throw them at you. So glad Nick is here for some reason let\\\\\\'s keep on not letting him leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dPlus life with Tom, as mentioned, is not extremely great.So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like, yeah, perfect, okay. Let\\\\\\'s get some Gatsby on.Four: No. No, there is not a chance of life not sucking. Life is terrible and so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into a gUY WHO IS JUST AS BAD.GUESS WHAT WASN\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T A COINCIDENCE? ANY OF THAT. All along, even the people you trusted most - Nick, Jordan, Gatsby - have been manipulating you. There have been secret plans and lies and tricks and all of these things just to get you to f*ck a guy.And if you think about it, Gatsby is not nice or romantic or kind or fair to lil ol Daisy. At all. His expectations are insane. He got to leave her and build a life for himself and live as he wanted and travel and make up this story and be wealthy and throw parties, while she lived with a cheating husband. And after all that, if she wants admission into the life that being with him might give her, she has to say no, she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever happy, there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a moment she loved Tom.Ridiculous.And when she plaintively says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI love you now. Isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that enough? I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help the past,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just begging Gatsby to accept her. How absolutely tragic. Tom cheats on her, Gatsby expects so much - she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never been fully, truly, without-exception loved.Five: Gatsby literally sucks oh my godDAISY IS JUST A SYMBOL OF GATSBY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S ABILITY TO CONQUER THE SOCIOECONOMIC CASTE SYSTEM OF THE 1920S. Like, if he can \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Daisy (literally an object), that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not even enough. He has to have HAD DAISY FOREVER. Because then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beaten Tom, the symbol of old money. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so gross, literally. Here are 2 quotes on Gatsby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfeelings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for Daisy which illustrate how much he sucks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy. It increased her value in his eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dHer VALUE. Like she is an OBJECT. Because OTHER MEN were not enough, so he is THE BEST MAN. Daisy must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve fallen short of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can think up in his ghostly heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dSo he made her into this manic-pixie-dream IDEA of a person, and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be mad at her for not living up to it? Nah. Nope. Not going to happen. Gatsby sucks.Six: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the responsible choice, you raging dingbatsSo AFTER she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already been pressured by Gatsby to act as though entire swaths of her life didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen, she finds out Gatsby has been lying to her all along - keeping the truth from her in order to protect this psychotic fairytale concoction of a totally goddamn made up story. Like! A! Total! Freak! What the f*ck would you do? If you were going to leave your sh*tty gross husband for what seems like a better life, but really has always been a lie - and a totally full on creepy one at that. And what if you had a daughter, who it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR you love and worry about and she loves you too, so much. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just leave her in the care of that sh*tty creepy cheating disgusting husband, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care less and would not be at all above using her as a chess piece??? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave her when everything you thought you knew was completely made up???? When it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been your dearest loved ones manipulating you all along???No, the f*ck you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Daisy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s choices were protecting her daughter, and sexy times with a con man. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no goddamn choice.She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s great and smart and responsible. It couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been easy for her to stay with Tom, who SUCKS. She says to his face that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crepulsive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But it was the grown-up option.TALK ABOUT A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. She is such a queen.Seven: Oh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, I forgot THE LAW THAT MARRIED COUPLES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN LEVELS OF BAD-NESS you foolsTom sucks. We know this. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a racist cheating bastard, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gross, and he hits Myrtle. He does plenty a\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terrible thing.But guess who is not automatically responsible for his actions??? Daisy, b*tch. She totally roasts him up for his Rise of the Colored Empires pseudo-science racism. She simply does not treat people in the same way Tom does. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not him. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the grouping of them both together like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s her fault. She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s totally trapped.Eight: Do we know that she knows that Gatsby died? Do we really, really, reallyyyyy know?When Nick calls her house, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. Like, do we honestlyyyyyy think that the dude who picked up the phone is actually going to tell her he called? Would you be rearing to go if a person you trusted who TOTALLY ACTUALLY MANIPULATED YOU hit you up after ignoring you for weeks like YOU ARE THE VILLAIN?Honestly, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no real sign that Daisy knew he died, but literally what did she owe him anyway. He manipulated her, lied to her, treated her like an object and nearly ruined her life. Totally made a terrible existence into full on garb\\\\xc3\\\\xa0ge. Whatever, man.Nine: The car thingShe was traumatized. Gatsby orchestrated the whole cover-up. He took the wheel, he drove away, he hid the car. She had no clue the whole thing would go horribly wrong. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the one who made all the choices in the aftermath. Duh.God this was so long. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m tired. And apologetic. Toward you, for having read a very long thing that I wrote, and toward myself, because I had to write it.This should certainly be enough to prove that Daisy Buchanan is a victim to her circumstances and otherwise noble and great and trying her goddamn best in a world in which everyone treats her like the beautiful fool she is totally not.Plus her voice is full of money.Now go off in your new happy life of being utterly enamored with Daisy Buchanan.--------------------pre-reviewDaisy Buchanan Is The Real Hero Of The Great Gatsby: A Thinkpiecewill be dropping my pi\\\\xc3\\\\xa8ce de r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sistance soon(this is my attempt at a fun way of saying, \"review to come and that review will blow your mind and make you realize that daisy is the best part of this book\")\\\\n  ...more\\\\n\\\\n          \\\\n        '"
